# Frontend Mentor challenge - NFT card

<p>
 This is my version for the frontendmentor.io challenge, which can be found <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U" target="_blank">here</a>.</br>
 To create this NFT preview card I used HTML and plain CSS. It was a fun challenge and my first one on Frontend Mentor! <br>
